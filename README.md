# Overview
JFrog Artifactory provides tight integration with VSTS and TFS through the **JFrog Artifactory VSTS Extension**.
Beyond managing efficient deployment of your artifacts to Artifactory, the extension lets you capture information about artifacts deployed, dependencies resolved, environment data associated with the build runs and more, 
that effectively facilitates fully traceable builds.
See the full extension documentation at the [VSTS and TFS Artifactory Extension User Guide](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/VSTS+and+TFS+Artifactory+Extension).
